    - **Auto Removal**:  This option will remove the background from the video automatically. This is the fastest and easiest option for videos that have a clear subject in the video. 

    - **Custom Removal**:  This option will allow you to remove the background from the video manually.  This option is useful for videos that have a different subject or background in the video.

    - **Chroma Key**:  This option will allow you to remove the background from the video using a color.  This option is useful for videos that have a green or blue screen.

The best option for you would be **Auto Removal**. But if you have a little complicated video, then you can switch to **Custom Removal**.

**4. Step 4** 
: If you select **Auto Removal**, then you will see an option to add a "stroke" around your cutout. Style your stroke by changing the color, size an opacity of the stroke to your liking. Try different styles and sizes to find the one that works best for you.
