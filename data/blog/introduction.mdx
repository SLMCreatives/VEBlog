## Introduction to the blog

Welcome to my video editing blog. This is where I will be sharing everything that I have learnt and continue to learn about video editing. My aim is to break down the complex skill of video editing. I want to focus on video editing for content and social media marketing; meaning creating videos for social media channels like YouTube and TikTok. 

First and foremost, I would like to thank you for visiting the site. I am developing this during my free time between my work as a freelance digital marketer. As I am just starting, it might take some time for this blog to actually be beneficial. But please be patient with me as I will try to share valuable content. 

Before we get into the content, let me share a little bit of what I have planned for this blog.

## Content

The main content of this blog is **video editing.** I plan to share a basic guide on everything that I have learnt about video editing in my 7 years of experience in video editing. Starting with the basics, I will start with the fundamentals of video editing which includes mastering the lingo, formats and codecs. Plus, I will also be sharing some essential editing techniques that every video editor should know and what is means. 

In addition, I will also go into video content marketing. I want to focus on the techniques, tips and skills one would need to develop a succefull social media channel with videos. As you may already know, develping a video channel on YouTube or TikTok can be very valuable for your personal or corporate brand, which can be profitable in the long run and essential in community building. 

Lastly, I would also want to share some of the latest trends, best practices as well as any relevant news in the industry. This will include topics such as TikTok trends and how to make them, new softwares as well as mobile editing, which has seen a large development over the past few years. 

## Who Will Benefit

Anybody who edits videos for a living or just for fun. The information shared in this blog will be valuable for those who wants to develop their video editing skills and who wants relevant information on the latest video editing trends and techniques. 

The content marketing articles will be highly beneficial for those who are interested in starting their very own YouTube/TikTok channel, either who wants to edit their own videos. I will be sharing relevant tips and tricks on how to improve your skill, shortcuts and trends that are currently being used in content marketing.

Even if you are not a video editor, learning this knowledge would make communicating with video editirs much easier, and would help you to communicate what you want to them. 

## Let's Begin

If you are ready to learn, let's begin. I will be starting with the absolute basics before we delve into the technicals of video editing. Although it might not seem relevant, mastering the foundation is essential for further developing.

I hope that this blog will be relevant and valuable to you. If you have information or topics that you want me to dicusss, feel free to message me on any of my channels and I will try to include that in the next post.
