## Welcome to the world of video editing

If you are just starting your journey or started to edit some videos, learning the fendamentals of video editing is valuable knowledge that you need to know. I want to go through some basic things that might not seem important, but will be important in increasing your knowledge about video editing.

You might have heard some of these terms before, but I will be starting with the absolute basics before we delve into the technicals of video editing. Although it might not seem relevant, mastering the foundation is essential for further developing.

Let's get started!

## Video Editing Lingo

In video editing, there are a lot of different terms that are used. I will be going through some of them and what they mean.

**Clip**
: An individual segment of recorded footage

**Timeline**
: The workspace where you arrange and edit your video clips

**Cut**
: A sharp transition from one clip to another

**Transition**
: A smoother effect used between clips, like a fade or dissolve

**Overlay**
: An additional image or text element placed on top of your video clip

**Audio Track**
: The sound component of your video, which can include dialogue, music, and sound effects

## File Formats and Codecs

Think of video files like a container that holds your video information and there are different container formats, each with it's own uses and advangates. On the other hand, codes are like compression tools that squeeze your video files into smaller sizes without sacrificing too much quality.

Some of these formats and codecs are used in specific scenarios while others might be used for a different use case. For example, I will be going through the the most common formats and codecs used in video editing.

### Common Video Formats

**MP4**
: A popular and versatile format widely used for online videos and social media.

**MOV**
: Commonly used on Apple devices and editing softwares like Final Cut Pro.

**AVI**
: An older video format used in some applications

### Common Video Codecs

**H.264**
: The most common codec used in video editing for MP4 videos. 

**H.265**
: A newer codec offering even better compression for high quality videos. (Not widely supported yet)

**HEVC**
: The most common codec used in video editing for AVI videos.

### Common Audio Codecs

**Lossless Codecs:**

**FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)**
: Preserves all original audio data, ideal for archiving high-fidelity audio or mastering projects where maintaining perfect quality is crucial.

**Lossy Codecs:**

**MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III)**
: The most widely recognized audio format, offering a good balance between compressed file size and sound quality. It's suitable for music streaming and general audio applications.

**AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)**
: A higher-quality alternative to MP3, often used for streaming services and digital downloads due to its improved efficiency at similar bitrates.

**M4A (MPEG-4 Audio)**
: A container format that often houses AAC-encoded audio. It's commonly used for Apple Music downloads and iTunes purchases.

### Video Bitrate

Video bitrate refers to the amount of data used per second in your video. It essentially determines the quality and file size of your video. The higher the bitrate, the more data/information that is stored in your video, therefore the higher the quality. This would also mean a higher file size.

Common bitrates used in video editing range from low resolutions with **around 2-5 Mbps** (ideal for social media uploads) to high-quality videos with **20 Mbps and up** (better suited for professional projects or Blu-ray discs). 

Choosing the right bitrate depends on your target platform and desired quality. Higher bitrates provide sharper images but result in larger file sizes, so finding a balance is key. 

### Most Used Video Settings

Most of the terms above will only be relevant when you want to export your video. As you may have seen, the export section of any video editing softwares can be a little intimidating. For now, you don't to worry about it too much. Here is a quick tip.

If you are planning to upload your video on social media, you can use the following settings:

- Format : MP4
- Codec : H.264
- Bitrate : 5 Mbps
- Audio Codec : AAC
- Audio Bitrate : 128 kbps

## Essential Editing Techniques

Here are some essential editing techniques that will come in handy for most social media video projects:

### Basic Cuts and Transitions:

**Cuts** 
: The most basic technique, switching between two clips with a clean transition.

**Dissolves**
: A gradual fade from one clip to another, creating a smoother transition.

**Fades**
: Gradually fading audio in or out at the beginning or end of a clip.


### Storytelling Techniques:

**Trimming**
: Removing unnecessary parts of a clip to tighten your video and improve pacing.

**B-Roll**
: Using supplementary footage (like scenery or close-up shots) to enhance your narrative.

**Cutaways**
: Briefly cutting away from the main action to show something else relevant.


### Engagement Techniques:

**Text Overlays**
: Adding text on screen to highlight key points or provide context.

**Call To Actions**
: Encouraging viewers to take a specific action, like subscribing or visiting your website.

**Music Sound Effects**
: Adding music and sound effects to enhance the mood, energy, and clarity of your video.


### Advanced Techniques (for those who are curious):

**Color Grading & Correction**
: Adjusting the colors in your video to create a specific mood or achieve a visually balanced look.

**Motion Graphics & VFX**
: Adding animated elements or visual effects to enhance your visuals and storytelling.

**Multicam Editing**
: Weaving footage from multiple cameras together to create a more dynamic and immersive experience. 


By mastering these essential techniques, you'll be well-equipped to create engaging and effective social media videos! 

## Conclusion

Well, this must be a lot to take in all at once. If you didn't get everything, or can't remember what everything means, it's really okay. I took some time to truly understand all of the terms and concepts as well. 

The best thing you can do right now is to keep these terms in mind. Once you get editing your videos, you will be able to understand these terms a little bit more and become a better video editor.
